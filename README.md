# Tetris (in Elm!)

Our _quest_ to follow the Elm Tetris Tutorial by "_Captain Coder_": 
https://youtu.be/GMSXYnMH1gg

Start by installing elm: https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html
Ensure that you have a text editor installed, 
in our case we are using Atom: https://atom.io

We are also using `elm-format` to make the code look "_`elm`-ish_".
In _my_ case I had to:

```sh
npm install elm-format -g
```
***AND***
```sh
apm install elm-format
```
If you get "_stuck_" installing the packages,
google for the error message you see and if you
are _still_ stuck after 10mins of googling,
open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/nelsonic/tetris/issues
